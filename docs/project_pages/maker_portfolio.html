<h2>A Foreword</h2>

<p>
    This is a collection of images and descriptions from the maker portfolio 
    that I used to apply to MIT. I haven't 
    edited it too much but its a good overview of some of 
    my previous projects. <br><br>

        Hi! I’m glad you could stop by.  I’m Ethan! <br><br>
        This is the beginning of the garage and, for our purposes, the start of my making journey.  <br><br>
        Around 2015, I had graduated middle school and built an
        electric go kart with inspiration from my school’s electric car
        club. It didn’t actually move, in part because my gear
        ratio from motor to wheel was too high, resulting in
        basically no torque. I was also swimming competitively around this
        time which resulted in me biking in the dark after
        our 2hr practices were up. You know what goes well
        with night? LEDs, and that’s how light bike came to
        be. <br><br>
        Through these early projects, I began to fall in love
        with making things. It was just so fascinating! So in
        2016, my family decided (via persuasion from me) to invest
        in a used Bridgeport milling machine and South Bend lathe
        (no longer with us). Little did they know what this
        would lead to…

<h2>Projects!</h2>

<h3>Belt Grinder</h3>

    <p>
        To get better at using the mill and lathe, I
        turned to Youtube for instruction. I watched hundreds and hundreds
        of making videos on all sorts of projects. In many
        of these, it seems that the presenters were building or
        had built their own tools — and among these, belt
        grinders were quite popular. So, as my first “big” project,
        I decided to build one too. Drawing on inspiration from
        all the different videos, I came up with this design.
        It uses crowned pulleys in the back to keep the
        belt on the pulleys and a door hinge and spring
        assembly for fine tracking adjustment and tension. I probably went
        overboard with the amount of solid aluminum stock, but hey,
        if I have a mill, I might as well practice. <br><br>
        Funny story about the motor, my friend’s father owned an
        electronics recycling place and occasionally invited me over to scrounge
        for parts. Almost everything I’ve made has something from there.

<h3>Pedestal Grinder</h3>

    <p>
        It turns out, I really like making machine tools.  
        After some browsing on Craigslist (where all the machines were coming from), 
        I found this grinder for $50.  
        At that price, I could probably make a profit selling the motor and scrapping the cast iron.  
        But instead, I thought I’d improve it a bit. <br><br> 

        The grinder did run, but the motor mount was inconvenient, 
        and, I’ll admit, the paint was bugging me a bit. <br><br> 

        I probably could have just slapped a new paint coat on it and been done, but that’s not my style.  
        I took this grinder apart as far as I could go, stripped all the paint, 
        then designed a new stand that placed the motor lower on the machine by rerouting the belt. <br><br>

    </p>

    <p>
        And this is what I ended up with!  
        There wasn’t a straight path for a belt from the new motor location to the spindle, 
        so I added some idler pulleys to redirect the belt.  
        To support these, I added some braces connecting the grinder frame directly to the motor mount.  
        Keep in mind that the vast majority of these projects were designed pencil on paper.  
        I only really started CAD with the CNC project and more complex projects after that.  <br><br>

<h3>Supermax Milling Machine</h3>
<table>

        <p>
            Ah, the Supermax.  
            This is one of, if not the biggest tool repair/modification I’ve done to date.  
            As with the grinder, this was a cheapo craigslist find.  
            The seller said the computer controller (CNC) system didn’t work (ok, no biggie right?).  
            When I got it home, turns out neither did the spindle or the head (nothing spun).  
            The machine base, however, was in near perfect shape (less than 0.002” backlash), 
            which justified fixing the rest.  <br><br>

            First step when something doesn’t work, 
            assess the damage and take it apart.  
            Pretty quickly, I realized that someone must have smashed the spindle, 
            while running, into some workpiece, frying the CNC system and breaking the 
            spindle, all in one shot.  It just so happened that someone was giving away a
             similar machine with a presumably functional head but shot base.  The perfect 
             match for my machine!  Off to the middle of nowhere I go to remove the head in 
             100 degree heat, then mix and match the parts. <br><br>

            Well, there’s never just one thing wrong.  
            On the first test run with the new spindle, smoke shot out the top of the motor 
            and the machine roared like a jet engine (not good).  
            Luckily, the smoke was just the belt slipping on some loose oil.  
            But the roar?  I had no clue.  <br><br>

            Eventually, after a second round of disassembly, 
            I realized that during the aforementioned crash, the 
            motor’s keyway and bushings must have been damaged.  
            This was causing a drive pulley to move all over the place, and, 
            coupled with a set of bad bearings, making a ruckus.  <br><br>

            I’m no motor repair expert, but I also wasn’t going to spend 
            more than the machine cost getting the motor fixed.  After a 
            long session of Youtube, I worked up the courage to weld up the motor shaft, 
            machine it down, cut a new keyway, and make a set of replacement bushings.  
            It actually worked really well, the shaft wasn’t warped, the pulley fit, 
            and the noise was virtually gone.  <br><br>

            At this point, the Supermax worked perfectly 
            as a manual mill but I never was able 
            to fix the old computer system.  Eventually, I opted to 
            convert the machine to run on Linux CNC (a free CNC 
            driver os) and to switch out the old motors and drivers 
            for newer steppers.  This was partially intended to be a test 
            run for designing and setting up a CNC system (for the 
            large CNC, next).  While I started out with no clue 
            how a CNC even works, everything turned out alright and the 
            machine moves in accordance to the computer.  <br><br>

            And it’s done!!!  It’s been almost three 
            years (75% of my time as decent maker) but 
            I’ve managed to take this broken machine and turn it 
            into a fully functional two axis CNC.  On the right, 
            you can see some projects and job shop work I’ve 
            done with the mill.  <br><br>

            I remember at the very beginning 
            of this project, someone mentioned the phrase “CNC,” only 
            to be met with my confused stare.  I couldn’t 
            have fathomed even taking the machine’s head apart, let 
            alone converting it into a, *gasp*, CNC.  But 
            if there’s one thing in the world I like doing,
            it’s designing and making just about anything; and 
            once I embark on a project, I’ll learn everything 
            I can to make that project come true.  <br><br>

<h3>The CNC</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="maker_portfolio_images/CNC 1.jpg"></td>
    <td>
        <p>
            A long time ago, I got a CNC router for Christmas.
            It worked alright, one in ten times.  A few 
            years down the road (present time) I’ve gotten 
            it to work better, but it’s never been well 
            suited for my needs.  <br><br>

            At first, I just wanted 
            to modify the router: Add bigger motors, switch to lead 
            screw instead of belt drive, that sort of stuff.  But 
            soon enough, I figured that if I’m gonna do 
            that much work, I might as well just build a new 
            machine altogether.  Now, a CNC is a lot more complex 
            than most projects and definitely not something that can be designed solely 
            on paper.  This prompted me to explore the free CAD software, 
            Fusion 360.  I also did a ton of research online 
            about general and specific CNC machine tool design, informing these models.
            I first made a design with a moving gantry (V1)
            but realized that material cost would be too high.  This 
            led to V2, and V3.  V3 is really where I 
            really started thinking about manufacturability (how to join those base castings 
            together, etc). <br><br>

            Originally, I was planning to make the CNC from concrete for 
            its low cost and high dampening properties.  As I did more 
            research, I concluded that concrete exhibits low dimensional stability, and 
            that a similar substance utilizing epoxy as the binder (epoxy granite
            ) is favored in the machine tool industry.  I also found 
            a variety of forum posts online about optimal compositions of epoxy granite,
             but no precise values.  This led me to conduct my 
            own mixture tests, using low viscosity epoxy and a mixture of 
            sand, glass nanospheres, and gravel as my aggregates.  I 
            also tested how well steel inserts could be cast into epoxy granite 
            blocks (pretty well actually).  <br><br>

            I was preparing to make the epoxy granite machine when my friend’s
            father (where the motor came from) offered me 8000lbs of 
            precision granite surface plates (the holy grail of precision machine tool 
            bases).  I couldn’t resist, and had them delivered 
            to the garage.  Unfortunately, this means that the machine must 
            be designed around those new plates.  Unlike the other designs, 
            I’ve been doing the granite CAD in Solidworks.  It
            ’s quite different from Fusion, but I really like all 
            the different parameters, the file system, and how well it 
            does with larger models.   <br><br>

            Of all the projects, I 
            think I’ve learned the most from this one.  This 
            is the project that started me with CAD, partly prompted the 
            Supermax CNC portion, and allowed me to realize how much I 
            enjoy the design and researching aspect of making things.  My hope 
            is to finish the granite design around winter break, and start 
            construction in the spring.   <br><br>

<h3>E-bike attachment</h3>

        <p>
            We will now leave the world of tools behind and instead look 
            towards electric vehicles.   <br><br>

            One day in sophomore year, I was sitting in class and 
            thought, “hmm, instead of making a full electric bike,
            could I make an attachment that converts my bike to electric 
            when installed, and leaves it as a normal bike when not 
            installed?”  This was the spark behind the E-bike attachment 
            project.  I eventually decided to attach the system to the water 
            bottle holder screws on my bike, add a secondary sprocket to 
            the back well, and run a chain from that sprocket to 
            a motor in the frame.   <br><br>

            The design was pencil on paper, and the actual geometry was 
            determined by trial and error (which causes the chain to rub 
            against the frame a bit), but for my first big vehicle 
            project, I’d say not too shabby!  <br><br>

            As with the belt grinder, this attachment contains excessive aluminum (
            See the theme here?) and can probably survive a crash at 
            25mph (how fast it goes) unscathed.  The motor is 
            from an electric scooter that I was given and the rest of 
            the electronics are off ebay and amazon. <br><br>
  
            This project was my 
            first big foray into electric vehicles, following the not so successful 
            electric car.  Some of the design choices are questionable (5
            /16” plate for the body? Really?)  But hey, it works.  
            Besides, questionable choices are bound to happen on the path of 
            learning.  I think I’m at least a bit more savvy now!   <br><br>

<h3>Electric Shopping Cart</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
    <td><img src="maker_portfolio_images/Shopping Cart 1.jpg"></td>
    <td>
        <p>
            You know, shopping carts are pretty slow…  We can change 
            that.   <br><br>

            This is V1 of the shopping cart project.  
            I think it’s the first time I welded something (
            yikes!) and probably one of the most kludged together things I
            ’ve made.  It did move, but whether that counts 
            as function is pretty dubious.  It’s like the electric 
            car I showed at the beginning: Functional? Not really.  
            But necessary to understand where I’m coming from.   <br><br>


            And why is the wheel placement like that? I’ve 
            always wanted to be able to ride the electric shopping cart as 
            if I were just shopping (Handlebar steers, stand behind the 
            cart).  This is pretty tricky to achieve, as somehow, 
            you have to have a pivot behind the body of the shopping 
            cart, yet still have pressure on the drive wheels to generate 
            drive force.  I found a better solution in V2.  <br><br>

        <p>
            I basically shoved the shopping cart in a corner for two years 
            while working on other projects.  Until, one of our robotics 
            team mentors said his work (Department of Water Management) had 
            a bunch of broken Lime-E and Bird scooters that had 
            been thrown in the creeks that he could give me.  I 
            couldn’t say yes any faster. <br><br>

            The hub motor 
            and rear wheel of each scooter were still functional, leading to 
            the current 5 wheel design of the cart.  I’d 
            also gotten a lot better at welding by this point, and 
            decided to weld a whole new frame.  While this is a 
            recent project, I decided to go the old pencil and paper 
            route and just design as I go. I also wanted to 
            make the whole system rainproof (something the bike was not) 
            which is the reasoning behind all the electronics boxes.   <br><br>

        <p>
            And it turned out really well!  I figured out that I 
            could steer similar to how a bike can be ridden no handed 
            by angling a single front wheel forward.  This system however was 
            susceptible to oscillations (caster wobble) and made the cart near 
            uncontrollable at certain speeds.  To combat this, I added the 
            bar to the front axle (shown previously) to increase the 
            system’s moment of inertia. This worked to a degree,
            but still produced oscillations (now at a different speed).  
            I then thought about how large towers combat oscillations with a liquid 
            filled damper.  The first bottle of liquid I found was a 
            coke bottle, which, once installed, worked so well 
            that it became the permanent damper.   <br><br>

            I’m pretty proud of this project.  I don’
            t think anyone’s built a _chariot style_ e-shopping 
            cart (although I think the first e-shopping cart is 
            from MIT).  And while I didn’t CAD this or 
            do anything precision, it’s definitely a huge step up 
            from my early electric vehicle projects.   <br><br>

            Now, we arrive at the “school” projects.  This 
            was from an AP Chem extra credit assignment (build a conductivity 
            meter).  I could have done something with tin foil and a 
            lightbulb, but I really wanted to try making glass and tungsten 
            probes (relatively inert materials) and see if I could mimic 
            the old style ammeters with a coil.  That led to this 
            design.  I played around with fusing tungsten inside some glass tubes 
            for the inert probes and with trying out some woodworking techniques on 
            the frame to get that vintage vibe.  I also discovered how 
            much fun copper wire is for making little levers and stuff.  
            The meter works well for differentiating between non-conductive, moderately 
            conductive, and uber conductive substances but (expectedly) doesn’t
            tell the operator too much else.  At this point in 
            shop history, I’d gotten pretty competent at making random 
            things; so, this was more of a “let your imagination run wild” project. <br><br>

            The more recent of the school projects, this was for the 
            “build a brain” AP Psych assignment.  Again, something 
            simple like play-doh would have worked, but where’
            s the fun in that?  I really loved working with copper 
            in the conductivity meter, so this time I went for a 
            full copper frame.  The sheets on top were hammered to represent 
            each lobe of the brain, while electronics components inside represent (
            in shape) each part of the brain.  A switchboard at 
            the base controls each part individually, allowing the user to associate 
            a labeled switch with the corresponding brain part.  And I couldn’t
            resist the idea *lightbulb* trope.  So, 
            when all the switches are turned on, the light turns on 
            too!  (via a relay).  Like the conductivity meter, 
            this was a “wild imagination” project.  It was a 
            ton of fun and something I couldn’t have dreamed of 
            doing three years prior.   <br><br>

<h3>Robotics in the Shop</h3>

        <p>
            In parallel to my own projects, I was (and still 
            am) a very active member of an FRC robotics team.  
            We are not affiliated with a school, and when I joined 
            four years ago, worked out of a residential one car garage 
            limited to hand tools.  Once I had set up shop, 
            gotten and set up more equipment, build tools, and figured 
            out how to run everything, I started inviting the team over 
            to machine.  It’s pretty nerve racking, demoing a 
            huge machine tool in front of an audience.  But watching everyone
            ’s smiles as they make their first cuts (as I 
            did years prior) makes the nerves more than worthwhile.  Now,
            I’m (along with the responsibilities of being build 
            captain) in charge of all machining that goes on in the 
            team, whether that be training members how to machine, or 
            organizing 5-7 teenagers into running all sorts of machine tools 
            simultaneously.    <br><br>

            Given that my FRC team is also on the small side, 
            I’ve been given the opportunity to design and machine certain 
            assemblies from start to finish.  This past year, I designed 
            the main pivot and pivot support for our arm, using custom 
            nylon bushings in an aluminum housing for the bearing element, and 
            pushing for the layered polycarbonate tower as a more compliant way to 
            support the arm (as opposed to a welded structure).  I 
            ended up machining the pivot assembly as well due to the relative 
            complexity of the parts.   <br><br>

            On the final days of build 
            season, I along with another designer were dissatisfied with the current 
            ball grabber. We bet the team that if we designed and 
            built one that functioned better than the current system, it would 
            be added to the robot. My contribution to that system was 
            the frame and chain guides, using layers of polycarbonate to guide 
            the chain smoothly around the ball, inspired by car engine chain 
            routing. As you can see, our system made it on the robot! <br><br>

            Around summer 2018, I met Professor Furman of the San Jose 
            State Spartan Superway Project in a truly serendipitous fashion.  At some 
            point, he mentioned a problem with their track, to which 
            I sat down and offered a potential solution.  That solution got 
            me invited to conference weekly with the project and more recently, 
            work with him and other college students over the summer.  During 
            this time, I designed and cadded a modular 12th scale track 
            and bogie assembly, intended to be cut on the waterjet and 
            laser cutter.  The bogie is designed to be 3D printed while 
            the protruding nubs serve as guides.  This, along with the 
            CNC, is where I really dove into solidworks CAD and where 
            I started to dabble in using FEA for my projects.  This 
            experience is also my first time using my making knowledge and applying 
            it to a much larger and more significant project.  Here is 
            a link to more details on the Superway and my work if 
            you are curious: https://jacqueshariel-ango-spartansuperway.blogspot.com/  <br><br>

<h3>Kuprion Inc.</h3>

        <p>
            When I work, I tend to keep the garage door open
            .  Thus, a decent portion of the neighborhood knows that a 
            machine shop lives in my garage.  One day, I got 
            a knock on my door from a neighbor who works at the 
            copper nanoparticle startup, Kuprion inc.  Apparently, they needed something 
            machined!  Given that I’m a highschooler, I offered 
            1-2 day turnaround and a minimal cost.  Well, 
            it seems they liked my work and, as such, have 
            been asking me to complete new jobs every now and then as 
            they get their copper production setup running.  So far, I
            ’ve made some baffles, modified their reactor lid, designed 
            and built a reagent dispenser, and designed and built a motor 
            adapter.  Considering that four years ago, I didn’t 
            know what a mill was, I’d say that designing 
            and machining for money is quite an improvement!  
            And apparently they think my work is pretty decent as well.   <br><br>

            Well that sure was a lot of projects, right?  Here
            ’s 16 more!  Jk, I had the space so 
            I thought I’d include an honorable mentions list.  Most 
            of these are just storage and organization for the garage.  At 
            some point, I also made copper coils for my school’
            s physics department and built a venus fly trap growing apparatus for 
            my room.  I think it just goes to show how much 
            infrastructure is needed to actually get a machine shop to function and 
            how I’ve managed to optimize my garage for maximum space efficiency.   <br><br>

            And this is it!  The garage as it currently stands.  
            These past four years have been a wild ride.  I’
            ve taken this garage from an empty room to a full fledged 
            machine shop.  I’ve made parts for a startup, 
            worked on a college project, made custom machines, built fun 
            vehicles, gone overboard with school projects, and hosted and mentored 
            my FRC team.  I’ve gone from not knowing how 
            a drill press works to designing my own CNC machine tools.  
            I’ve kindled my love of making and taken my projects 
            to the next level.  Quite frankly, I’m proud 
            of how far I’ve come.  And as the next 
            stage of life approaches, I’m eager to make so much more! <br><br>

<h2>Some background for curious people (Circa 2019 and not entirely accurate)</h2>

<h3>What do I make</h3>
<p>
I make machine tools, relevant machine shop accessories 
(shelving, tool storage, tables, etc), electric vehicles, 
novel vintage style science electronics, and parts of 
FRC robots.  The machine tools are either entirely custom 
or a modification of an older or broken machine.  
Of course, to run machine tools in a garage, a 
certain degree of infrastructure is required.  Thus, I’ve 
built some tool and material storage, along with 
workbenches.  And as more of a “get loose” style 
of project, I like making electric vehicles using 
reclaimed e-scooter and e-bike electronics.  
In addition, given the small size of my FRC team, 
I’ve had the privilege of making certain assemblies 
from start to finish.  And, sometimes, in school, 
we are given some open ended task like “build a brain 
model”.  For these, I like to go retro and design 
something fun using wood, copper, and vintage looking 
electronics.
</p>

<h3>How do I make</h3>
<p>
I’ve turned my residential garage into a full 
blown machine shop. Using machine tools I’ve built, restored, or found on Craigslist, I 
machine my creations from raw steel and aluminum stock. 
On occasion, I will also weld (using an 
old Miller stick welder) steel tube together to make 
various machine frames. I use Solidworks CAD to design 
more technical projects (CNC mill), Fusion 360 CAM 
to drive the CNC router and retrofitted mill, and 
paper and pencil for the get loose projects. No 
one else in my family is a big “maker
,” thus 95% of what I know has come 
from watching machinists, woodworkers, and fabricators on Youtube
. By peering into their workshops for hours on end
, I embark on a “virtual apprenticeship,” obtaining 
tips of the trade from the best in the business. 
</p>

<h3>What is my most significant project?</h3>
<p>
    My most significant project is my (in progress) custom CNC
    mill. I tend to make projects based off some initial
    curiosity (Hey, I got a cnc router kit but it
    doesn’t work very well, let’s make it better!) and then
    go from there. This project started out innocently enough (let’s
    weld a new frame, upgrade the motors, and be done).
    But then I decided I wanted a larger work envelope
    and better rigidity, which led to the question of manufacturability,
    which led to research in epoxy granite machines, which led
    to epoxy granite mixture testing, which led to me getting
    free 2000lb granite surface plates from a friend, which leads
    to the current state of the project at CAD of
    the granite design. This meandering of exploration through all the
    fascinating intricacies of a project is the epitome of why
    I make anything. And why, although yet to be completed,
    my CNC project is so meaningful to me.
