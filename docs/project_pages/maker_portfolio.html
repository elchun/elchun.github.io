        Hi! I’m glad you could stop by.  I’m Ethan! <br><br>
        This is the beginning of the garage and, for our purposes, the start of my making journey.  <br><br>
        Around 2015, I had graduated middle school and built an
        electric go kart with inspiration from my school’s electric car
        club. It didn’t actually move, in part because my gear
        ratio from motor to wheel was too high, resulting in
        basically no torque. I was also swimming competitively around this
        time which resulted in me biking in the dark after
        our 2hr practices were up. You know what goes well
        with night? LEDs, and that’s how light bike came to
        be. <br><br>
        Through these early projects, I began to fall in love
        with making things. It was just so fascinating! So in
        2016, my family decided (via persuasion from me) to invest
        in a used Bridgeport milling machine and South Bend lathe
        (no longer with us). Little did they know what this
        would lead to…

<h2>Some background for curious people (Circa 2019 and not entirely accurate)</h2>

<h3>What do I make</h3>
<p>
I make machine tools, relevant machine shop accessories 
(shelving, tool storage, tables, etc), electric vehicles, 
novel vintage style science electronics, and parts of 
FRC robots.  The machine tools are either entirely custom 
or a modification of an older or broken machine.  
Of course, to run machine tools in a garage, a 
certain degree of infrastructure is required.  Thus, I’ve 
built some tool and material storage, along with 
workbenches.  And as more of a “get loose” style 
of project, I like making electric vehicles using 
reclaimed e-scooter and e-bike electronics.  
In addition, given the small size of my FRC team, 
I’ve had the privilege of making certain assemblies 
from start to finish.  And, sometimes, in school, 
we are given some open ended task like “build a brain 
model”.  For these, I like to go retro and design 
something fun using wood, copper, and vintage looking 
electronics.
</p>

<h3>How do I make</h3>
<p style="width:600px">
I’ve turned my residential garage into a full 
blown machine shop. Using machine tools I’ve built, restored, or found on Craigslist, I 
machine my creations from raw steel and aluminum stock. 
On occasion, I will also weld (using an 
old Miller stick welder) steel tube together to make 
various machine frames. I use Solidworks CAD to design 
more technical projects (CNC mill), Fusion 360 CAM 
to drive the CNC router and retrofitted mill, and 
paper and pencil for the get loose projects. No 
one else in my family is a big “maker
,” thus 95% of what I know has come 
from watching machinists, woodworkers, and fabricators on Youtube
. By peering into their workshops for hours on end
, I embark on a “virtual apprenticeship,” obtaining 
tips of the trade from the best in the business. 
</p>

<h3>What is my most significant project?</h3>
<p style="width:600px">
    My most significant project is my (in progress) custom CNC
    mill. I tend to make projects based off some initial
    curiosity (Hey, I got a cnc router kit but it
    doesn’t work very well, let’s make it better!) and then
    go from there. This project started out innocently enough (let’s
    weld a new frame, upgrade the motors, and be done).
    But then I decided I wanted a larger work envelope
    and better rigidity, which led to the question of manufacturability,
    which led to research in epoxy granite machines, which led
    to epoxy granite mixture testing, which led to me getting
    free 2000lb granite surface plates from a friend, which leads
    to the current state of the project at CAD of
    the granite design. This meandering of exploration through all the
    fascinating intricacies of a project is the epitome of why
    I make anything. And why, although yet to be completed,
    my CNC project is so meaningful to me.
