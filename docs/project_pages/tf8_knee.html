        Mechatronics Upgrades to the TF8 Powered Prosthetic Knee

      <p>
        The <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9492290" target="_blank">TF8 actuator system</a>, developed
        by Matt Carney, Tony Shu, and others is a powered prosthetic joint system.  It was designed for use
        as a both an ankle, as well as knee prosthesis.  However, previous testing had not used the TF8
        system as a knee prosthesis.  Over the course of several months, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tonyshu/overview/" target="_blank">Tony Shu</a>
        and I worked to transition an existing TF8 system to knee configuration and are currently evaluating
        the system on a variety of subjects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was responsible for physical integration of our Verdin electronics stack onto the new device
        and for designing end-of-travel stops to simulate a human knee.  This involved designing a robust
        electronics mounting system and experimenting with a variety of end-of-travel stop designs and
        materials.
