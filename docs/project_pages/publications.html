<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    One of my favorite things to do is explore.  I explore by walking around
    the city.  I explore by finding new pathways through campus.  I
    explore by solving new algorithms or math problems.  But my
    favorite type of exploration is trying things that nobody has ever done
    before.  Naturally, this implies that I really enjoy working on research
    questions!  I'm currently working at Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
    (Leslie Kaelbling and Tomas Lozano-Perez) and Biomechatronics (Hugh Herr).
    In LIS, I work on robotic manipulation using convolutional occupancy
    networks as autoencoders for point clouds.  At Biomech, I build and test
    robotic ankles and knees to restore walking, getting up, and climbing
    stairs for trans-tibial and trans-femoral amputees.

    The following are some interesting bits from my research at these labs,
    as well as links to my publications.<br><br>

<h2>Local Neural Descriptor Fields: Locally Conditioned Object Representations for Manipulation
</h2>

<p>
    Here, we are developing a way to teach a robot how to manipulate objects
    based on very few demonstrations.  Previous works can manipulate objects that
    are from the same object class as the demonstrations (e.g. mug demos --> mug
    manipulation); however they cannot generalize to new object classes
    (mug demos --> bowl with handle manipulation).  Our thesis is that a
    local encoding of the shape would allow for better generalization.  For
    example, grabbing a handle shouldn't be affected by what the handle is
    attached to.

    The paper has just been submitted to ICRA 2023 so I can't quite link the pdf,
    but I'll update this at some point!

<h2>Modulation of Prosthetic Ankle Plantarflexion Through Direct Myoelectric Control of a Subject-Optimized Neuromuscular Model
</h2>

<p>
    The title is long, but basically we made a robot ankle that helps our
    subject stand on their tip toes (something that can't be done with any
    other system), among other tasks.  I did a lot of the mechatronics
    and code implementation while my supervisor developed the muscle model
    that interprets our input electrode (EMG) signals.

    The paper is <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9798884">here</a>!

        Hi! I’m glad you could stop by.  I’m Ethan! <br><br>
        This is the beginning of the garage and, for our purposes, the start of my making journey.  <br><br>
        Around 2015, I had graduated middle school and built an
        electric go kart with inspiration from my school’s electric car
        club. It didn’t actually move, in part because my gear
        ratio from motor to wheel was too high, resulting in
        basically no torque. I was also swimming competitively around this
        time which resulted in me biking in the dark after
        our 2hr practices were up. You know what goes well
        with night? LEDs, and that’s how light bike came to
        be. <br><br>
        Through these early projects, I began to fall in love
        with making things. It was just so fascinating! So in
        2016, my family decided (via persuasion from me) to invest
        in a used Bridgeport milling machine and South Bend lathe
        (no longer with us). Little did they know what this
        would lead to…
