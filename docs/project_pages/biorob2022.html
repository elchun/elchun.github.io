        Abstract—The ideal neuroprosthetic control paradigm minimizes disparities in dynamic performance and subjective
        embodiment between artificial and intact physiology. In this letter, we address the former by introducing the Activation
        Mapping paradigm,
        a cascaded optimization procedure that enables a subject with unilateral transtibial amputation to neurally modulate the
        torque developed during prosthetic ankle plantarflexion. Specifically, in the
        first stage, the optimization procedure develops a digital locomotor
        clone that recovers symmetric gait dynamics for the hypothetical
        subject prior to amputation. In the second stage, the resultant
        ankle torque-angle trajectory serves as a reference to optimize over
        the morphological parameters of a neuromuscular ankle model.
        The optimized model contains a single agonist-antagonist muscle
        pair driven by a recording of the subject’s within-socket walking
        electromyograms that reproduces the reference ankle dynamics.
        In this manner, the subject’s natural residual muscular activations
        are mapped to their idealized gait dynamics to form a one degree-of-freedom neuromuscular ankle controller. The
        subsequent implementation of the activation map on a powered ankle prosthesis
        enables the subject to not only generate physiological ankle dynamics to increase their self-selected walking speed from
        1.22 m/s
        to 1.33 m/s, but also to volitionally perform bilaterally symmetric
        standing calf raises while balancing for at least 2.0 seconds.
