        Cat Ears

      <p>
        My friend always wanted a pair of cat ears.  They're great for all sorts of occasions -- halloween,
        formal dining, research conferences...  I also figured it'd be a fun project over winter break so here
        we are.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        I was going for an industrial cyberpunk aesthetic here, reminiscent of Akira or Ghost in the Shell.
        The ears are intentionally asymmetric to give the impression of a hasty construction.  The various
        color pallets were also selected to invoke this chaotic atmosphere.
      </p>


      <h2>Construction</h2>
      <p>
        The guts are very similar to that of the <a href=/project_pages/bird.html>bird lamp</a>.
        Inside is a small neopixel ring, a three led line, and two individual neopixels for backlighting.
        An arduino nano is used for control and Molex Picoblades were used for easy reconfiguration.
        A small button allows the user to toggle between control modes.

        The two ears and electronics holder were modeled in <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription">Fusion 360</a>
        and 3D printed in carbon fiber filled nylon.
      </p>

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>
        I made a pretty basic arduino <a href="https://github.com/elchun/ears_source_code">script</a> to run the lights.
        It takes input from a button and allows the user to toggle between a spinning mode, pure colors, rainbow,
        and a color picker.  The color picker allows a user to send a rgb color code over serial to the ears.
        This is then displayed with the built in neopixels.  While it probably would have been easier to just
        choose colors with guess and check, I thought it'd be fun to be able to update colors live if
        connected to the serial port.
